Allan: 
A single unified function can be done but it will have a ton of arguments.
Overall the rate of acceleration per state differs also, driving to the ball can be done rapidly, with little care to precision, while aiming should be done with care and acceleration can not be as rough
If I had to make a function, I would do something like this:
calculateMotion(targetOffset, maxTargetOffset, minTargetOffset, minSpeed, maxSpeed, speedScaleFunction)
targetOffset = error between wanted object location and actual location
maxTargetOffset = maximum error expected, for centralizing a ball, for example, half of the screen width
minTargetOffset = offset that is considered to round down to 0. Useful for when speed is more important that accuracy, for example throwing from close range (centering of basket does not need to be spot on). Also can be used to reduce some noise effects when target is close to desired area
minSpeed = minimum turning speed that is used while offset is not minimized. Needed because robot tends to not move on ultra small speeds.
maxSpeed = maximum allowed speed.
speedScaleFunction = mapping function that describes how the normalized error will be scaled. Useful when you want to accelerate much with distant objects but need slow precise movements close-by in the same state.
----
you can also add previousSpeed and acceleration parameters to controll the rate of change in speeds
For simplicity I would skip the speedScaleFunction for now
